This post contains some of my work that featured exploratory data analysis and visualizations. All graphics are written in R, using the ggplot2 package. Embedded graphics will be in a future update, but for now all of them are stored in linked PDF files. Dashboards and interactive visualizations will eventually show up. 

All code/graphics was written by me. 

[Example 1](/pset1.pdf) - I explored family income and inequality trends in a short problem set.

[Example 2](/423ProjectAnalysis.pdf) - This longer project analysis featured EDA, regression and diagnostic plots.

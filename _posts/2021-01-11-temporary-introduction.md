Hello, I'm Daniel. This site serves primarily as a (written?) repository about the projects I've done and tangential thoughts in statistics, data science, mathematics, etc. I also intend to track progress in stuff I'm actively learning and competing in, e.g. Leetcode and Kaggle. Interesting (math) problems and corresponding solutions will also occasionally show up here - a "career stuff only" website is very intellectually bankrupt and not that fun to keep up.

I'm 25 years old with a MSc. in statistics. I work mostly in R and python, with familiarity in SQL (PostgreSQL). I'm currently expanding my techstack vis-a-vis learning AWS dev stuff, kubernetes/docker etc.

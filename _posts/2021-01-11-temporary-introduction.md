Hello, I'm Daniel. This site serves as a (written?) repository about the projects I've done and tangential thoughts in statistics, data science, mathematics, etc. I also intend to track progress in stuff I'm actively learning and competing in, e.g. Leetcode and Kaggle.

I'm 25 years old with a MSc. in statistics. I work mostly in R and python, with familiarity in SQL. I'm currently learning AWS development.
